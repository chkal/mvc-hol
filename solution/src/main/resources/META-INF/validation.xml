  <!--
    You can use Bean Validation's configuration file to change the default behaviour for
    validating method invocations. If you change the default to NONE, you won't need to
    use @ValidateOnExecution on your controller methods any more. But please note that
    this will also affect non-controller methods. Which way to choose is basically
    a matter of taste. 
    
    This is currently the only way to get validation working in GlassFish due to issues with Jersey
